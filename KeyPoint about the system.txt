1. Correct domain model (what your system really is)Your data model already implies this, even if the mock API didn’t yet:Nodes exist independently (nodeMap)Parent–child relationships are optional (edges)A node without a parent is a rootThere can be many roots“Space” is a semantic root type, not a technical root IDSo your graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph with multiple roots (a forest).2. Industry parity (important reassurance)This exact pattern is used by:Notion (new page at root vs inside page)Obsidian (new folder vs note)VS Code (new folder at root vs inside)Linear (new issue vs sub-issue)You are aligned with best practice.
